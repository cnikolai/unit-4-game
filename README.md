# Jewel Guessing Game

## Overview

This is a Jewel guessing game. The [project start page](https://cnikolai.github.io/unit-4-game) can be found here. 

### Problem 
In this game, the user gets a ramdon predetermined number of "life."  The user then is presented with 4 different Jewels on the screen.  The user can select a Jewel, and it increases the current life of the user for the current game.  The user keeps selecting Jewels in this manner until either s/he reaches the exact predetermined number of "life" or the user busts the predetermined number of life.  Stats are presented to the user after each round of game.  

### How I solved it
This game uses only frontend technology.  

### Technical Approach
I solved this problem by using a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript.  I used HTML to create the basic page structure. I used CSS to format the page.  I used jQuery's onClick() function to process when the user clicks on a Jewel.  I used jQuery to edit and update the DOM after each player turn and after each game.
